# Individual-household-electric-power-consumption-prediction-using-time-series-analysis

Second project of Introduction to Neuroscience. Dataset is [Individual household electric power consumption Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption) from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The project includes application of:
a simple full connected model, 
an LSTM based model (with and without dropout),
a GRU based model (with and without dropout),
a stacking recurrent model (combination of GRU and LSTM layers),
a bidirectional recurrentmodel (GRU and LSTM),
the combination of CNN and RNN (1D convolutional model with GRU andLSTM).
